LockDown - XPOSED
=========

Lockdown - XPOSED is a module for the Xposed framework for Android.
LockDown allows you to add multiple PINs to unlock your phone. Every PIN is a profile and you can restrict certain apps from launching when using a certain profile. You can even choose to hide the apps from the drawer completely so the user will not know if they are locked out.

**NOTE**
The current build on Google Play is NOT the same as the build on this repository *yet*
This repository is for the next update which is completely rewritten from ground up. Once this update is ready the Google Play build will be updated with this build.
It will also be available on the XPOSED modules repository then.

Installation
--------------
The latest stable release can be found on Google Play [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitishkasturia.lockdown)

Alternatively you can clone this repository and build the module yourself
